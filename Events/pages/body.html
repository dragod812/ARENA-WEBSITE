    <ul>
      <li>Choose three poses- A forward facing, Rear facing and side facing and perform them in one of the following orders-
      <br>Choose front or side facing pose as your first and last pose. Rear facing pose should be the second one as it does not look good to walk of stage after performing your rear pose. Make these poses individual by adding bend, dips, bows and waves to your presentation.</li>
      <li>Hold each pose for 3-5 seconds.</li>
      <li>Some of the common poses are given below. You can do the same for your presentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Front double biceps -</h2>
    <p> Standing face front to the judges, with one leg 40-50 cm forward and to the side, the competitor will raise both arms to shoulder level and bend them at the elbows. The hands should be clenched and turned down so as to cause a contraction of the biceps and forearm muscles, which are the main muscle groups that are to be assessed in this pose. In addition, the competitor should attempt to contract as many other muscles as possible as the judges will be surveying the whole physique, from head to toe.</p>
    <h2>Side chest -</h2>
    <p>The competitor may choose either side for this pose, in order to display the “better” arm. He will stand with his left or right side towards the judges and will bend the arm nearest the judges to a right-angle position, with the fist clenched and, with the other hand, will grasp the wrist. The leg nearest the judges will be bent at the knee and will rest on the toes. The competitor will then expand the chest and by upward pressure of the front bent arm and contract the biceps as much as possible. </p>
    <h2>Back double biceps -</h2>
    <p>Standing with his back to the judges, the competitor will bend the arms and wrists as in the Front Double Biceps pose, and will place one foot back, resting on the toes. He will then contract the arm muscles as well as the muscles of the shoulders, upper and lower back, thigh and calf muscles.</p>
