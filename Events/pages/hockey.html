    <h2>TERMINIOLOGY</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Back-line :The shorter (55 metres) perimeter line.</li>
      <li>Goal-line: The back-line between the goal-posts. </li>
      <li>Side-line: The longer (91.40 metres) perimeter line.</li>
      <li>Circle: The area enclosed by and including the two quarter circles and the lines joining them at each end of the field opposite the centre of the back-lines.  </li>
      <li><em>23 metres area :The area enclosed by and including the line across the field 22.90 metres from each back-line, the relevant part of the side-lines, and the back-line.</em> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>FIELD</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The field of play is rectangular, 91.40 metres long and 55.00 metres wide.</li>
      <li>Lines known as 23 metres lines are marked across the field 22.90 metres from each back-line.</li>
      <li>Field players who leave the field for injury treatment, refreshment, to change equipment or for some reason other than substitution are only permitted to re-enter between the 23 metres areas on the side of the field used for substitutions.</li>.
    </ul>
    <p>PLAYERS DO AND DONT’S</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A match is played between two teams with not more than eleven players of each team on the field at the same time.</li>
      <li>Players on the field must hold their stick and not use it in a dangerous way. 23 Players must not lift their stick over the heads of other players.</li>
      <li>Players must not touch, handle or interfere with other players or their sticks or clothing. </li>
      <li>Players must not intimidate or impede another player. </li>
      <li>Players must not play the ball with the back of the stick.</li>
      <li>Players must not hit the ball hard on the forehand with the edge of the stick. This does not prohibit use of the edge of the stick on the forehand in a controlled action in a tackle, when raising the ball in a controlled way over an opponent’s stick or over a goalkeeper or player with goalkeeping privileges who is lying on the ground or when using a long pushing motion along the ground. The use of the edge of the stick on the backhand has developed as a technical skill and is permitted subject to danger. </li>
      <li>Players may stop, receive and deflect or play the ball in a controlled manner in any part of the field when the ball is at any height including above the shoulder unless this is dangerous or leads to danger.</li>
      <li>Players must not play the ball dangerously or in a way which leads to dangerous play. A ball is also considered dangerous when it causes legitimate evasive action by players. The penalty is awarded where the action causing the danger took place.</li>
      <li><em>Players must not intentionally raise the ball from a hit except for a shot at goal. 24 A raised hit must be judged explicitly on whether or not it is raised intentionally. It is not an offence to raise the ball unintentionally from a hit, including a free hit, anywhere on the field unless it is dangerous. If the ball is raised over an opponent’s stick or body on the ground, even within the circle, it is permitted unless judged to be dangerous. Players are permitted to raise the ball with a flick or scoop provided it is not dangerous. A flick or scoop towards an opponent within 5 metres is considered dangerous. If an opponent is clearly running into the shot or into the attacker without attempting to play the ball with their stick, they should be penalised for dangerous play. </em></li>
      <li><em>Players must not approach within 5 metres of an opponent receiving a falling raised ball until it has been received, controlled and is on the ground. The initial receiver has a right to the ball. If it is not clear which player is the initial receiver, the player of the team which raised the ball must allow the opponent to receive it.</em></li>
      <li>Field players must not stop, kick, propel, pick up, throw or carry the ball with any part of their body. It is not always an offence if the ball hits the foot, hand or body of a field player. The player only commits an offence if they gain an advantage or if they position themselves with the intention of stopping the ball in this way. It is not an offence if the ball hits the hand holding the stick but would otherwise have hit the stick.</li>
      <li>Players must not obstruct an opponent who is attempting to play the ball. 25 Players obstruct if they : – back into an opponent – physically interfere with the stick or body of an opponent – shield the ball from a legitimate tackle with their stick or any part of their body. A stationary player receiving the ball is permitted to face in any direction. A player with the ball is permitted to move off with it in any direction except bodily into an opponent or into a position between the ball and an opponent who is within playing distance of the ball and attempting to play it. A player who runs in front of or blocks an opponent to stop them legitimately playing or attempting to play the ball is obstructing (this is third party or shadow obstruction). This also applies if an attacker runs across or blocks defenders (including the goalkeeper or player with goalkeeping privileges) when a penalty corner is being taken.</li>
      <li>Players must not tackle unless in a position to play the ball without body contact. Reckless play, such as sliding tackles and other overly physical challenges by field players, which take an opponent to ground and which have the potential to cause injury should attract appropriate match and personal penalties. </li>
      <li>Players must not intentionally enter the goal their opponents are defending or run behind either goal. </li>
      <li>Players must not change their stick between the award and completion of a penalty corner or penalty stroke unless it no longer meets the stick specification. </li>
      <li>Players must not throw any object or piece of equipment onto the field, at the ball, or at another player, umpire or person. Following a penalty corner, if the ball hits any discarded equipment, such as a hand protector, knee pads or a face mask, a free hit should be awarded if this occurs outside the circle, and a penalty corner awarded if this occurs inside the circle.</li>
      <li>Players must not delay play to gain benefit by time-wasting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Umpire: If the ball strikes an umpire, unauthorised person or any loose object on the field, play continues (except as specified in the guidance to Rule 9.16).<br></p>
    <h2>Penalties</h2>
    <p>Advantage: a penalty is awarded only when a player or team has been disadvantaged by an opponent breaking the Rules. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A free hit is awarded to the opposing team: a for an offence by any player between the 23 metres areas.</li>
      <li>A penalty corner is awarded:
        <ul>
          <li>for an offence by a defender in the circle which does not prevent the probable scoring of a goal </li>
          <li>for an intentional offence in the circle by a defender against an opponent who does not have possession of the ball or an opportunity to play the ball </li>
          <li>for an intentional offence by a defender outside the circle but within the 23 metres area they are defending </li>
          <li>for intentionally playing the ball over the back-line by a defender 30 Goalkeepers or players with goalkeeping privileges are permitted to deflect the ball with their stick, protective equipment or any part of their body in any direction including over the back-line.</li>
          <li>when the ball becomes lodged in a player’s clothing or equipment while in the circle they are defending.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>A penalty stroke is awarded: </em>
        <ul>
          <li>for an offence by a defender in the circle which prevents the probable scoring of a goal </li>
          <li>for an intentional offence in the circle by a defender against an opponent who has possession of the ball or an opportunity to play the ball </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If there is another offence or misconduct before the awarded penalty has been taken:
      <ul>
        <li>A more severe penalty may be awarded</li>
        <li>A personal penalty may be awarded </li>
        <li>the penalty may be reversed if the subsequent offence was committed by the team first awarded the penalty</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>HOW TO TAKE PENALTIES</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Location of a free hit:
        <ul>
          <li>a free hit is taken close to where the offence occurred ‘Close to’ means within playing distance of where the offence occurred and with no significant advantage gained. The location from which a free hit is taken must be more precise inside the 23 metres area. </li>
          <li>a free hit awarded to the defence within 15 metres of the back-line is taken up to 15 metres from the backline in line with the location of the offence, parallel to the side-line </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Procedures for taking a free hit, centre pass and putting the ball back into play after it has been outside the field:
All parts of this Rule apply as appropriate to a free hit, centre pass and putting the ball back into play after it has been outside the field.

        <ul>
          <li>The ball must be stationary </li>
          <li>Opponents must be at least 5 metres from the ball If an opponent is within 5 metres of the ball, they must not interfere with the taking of the free hit or must not play or attempt to play the ball. If this player is not playing the ball, attempting to play the ball or influencing play, the free hit need not be delayed.</li>
          <li>When a free hit is awarded to the attack within the 23 metres area, all players other than the player taking the free hit must be at least 5 metres from the ball, except as specifically indicated below for attacking free hits awarded within 5 metres of the circle</li>
          <li>The ball is moved using a hit, push, flick or scoop. </li>
          <li>The ball may be raised immediately using a push, flick or scoop but must not be raised intentionally using a hit</li>
          <li>from a free hit awarded to the attack within the 23 metres area, the ball must not be played into the circle until it has travelled at least 5 metres, not necessarily in a single direction, or has been touched by a player of the defending team 32 If the player taking the free hit continues to play the ball (ie no defending player has yet touched it): – that player may play the ball any number of times, but – the ball must travel at least 5 metres, before – that player plays the ball into the circle by hitting or pushing the ball again.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>PC(Taking a penalty corner) </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The ball is placed on the back-line inside the circle at least 10 metres from the goal-post on whichever side of the goal the attacking team prefers.</li>

      <li>The other attackers must be on the field, outside the circle with sticks, hands and feet not touching the ground inside the circle</li>
      <li>No defender or attacker other than the attacker taking the push or hit from the back-line is permitted to be within 5 metres of the ball when the push or hit is taken</li>
      <li>Not more than five defenders, including the goalkeeper or player with goalkeeping privileges if there is one, must be positioned behind the back-line with their sticks, hands and feet not touching the ground inside the field</li>
      <li>The other defenders must be beyond the centre-line</li>
      <li>Until the ball has been played, no attacker other than the one taking the push or hit from the back-line is permitted to enter the circle and no defender is permitted to cross the centre-line or back-line</li>
      <li>After playing the ball, the attacker taking the push or hit from the back-line must not play the ball again or approach within playing distance of it until it has been played by another player</li>
      <li>the penalty corner Rules no longer apply if the ball travels more than 5 metres from the circle</li>
      <li>The penalty corner is completed when:
        <ul>
          <li>A goal is scored</li>
          <li>A free hit is awarded to the defending team</li>
          <li>The ball is played over the back-line and a penalty corner is not awarded</li>

          <li>A penalty stroke is awarded</li>
          <li>A bully is awarded.<br>

            <li>A defender, other than the goalkeeper, crosses the back-line or goal-line before permitted, the offending player is required to go beyond the centre-line and cannot be replaced by another defender : the penalty corner is taken again</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Rule 7.4.c: ball intentionally played over the back-line by a defender and no goal is scored. If it is clear that the action is intentional, umpires should not hesitate to award a penalty corner.</p>
    <h2>PERSONAL PENALTIES</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>For any offence, the offending player may be:
        <ul>
          <li>Cautioned (indicated by spoken words) </li>
          <li>Warned and temporarily suspended for 2 minutes of playing time (indicated by a green card)</li>
          <li>Temporarily suspended for a minimum of 5 minutes of playing time (indicated by a yellow card)</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      Rule 7.4.c: ball intentionally played over the back-line by a defender and no goal is scored. If it is clear that the action is intentional, umpires should not hesitate to award a penalty corner.<br>
      Rule 9.12: obstruction. Umpires should penalise shielding the ball with the stick more strictly. They should also look out for a tackling player who by pushing or leaning on an opponent causes them to lose possession of the ball. <br>
      Rule 13.2.a: ball stationary at a free hit. Umpires are sometimes not strict enough on requiring the ball to be stationary, albeit very briefly, for a free hit especially if it is taken using a self-pass.<br>
