    <h1>Kabaddi</h1>
    <h2>BASIC RULES OF KABADDI:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Kabaddi is a high intensity contact sport where the objective is to enter the opponent’s half of the court, tag their players and successfully return back.</li>
      <li>The sport is contested by two teams consisting of seven players each. Each team starts the game with seven players on court and five substitutes on the bench.</li>
      <li>Each Kabaddi match spans a duration of 20 minutes comprising of events called raids.(That may change accordingly)</li>
      <li>A raid starts when a player enters the opposition court. A player who enters the opposition half of the court for a raid is called a raider.</li>
      <li>A player from the opposition team who tackles or has the opportunity to tackle a raider is called a defender.</li>
      <li>The maximum duration of each raid is 30 seconds and during the raid, the raider has to keep chanting "Kabaddi Kabaddi", known as the Cant.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>SCORING SYSTEM</h2>
    <h3>Raid Point (Touch, Bonus)</h3>
    <p>When a raider enters the opposition half for a raid, he has two means to score points:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bonus Point –With six or more defenders on court, if a raider crosses the bonus line, with the trailing foot in the air, the raider gets a bonus point.</li>
      <li>Touch Point –When a raider initiates a touch on one or more defenders and returns to the mid line, he gets touch points equivalent to the number of defenders he has touched. Those defenders are forced out of play and an equivalent number of players from the raiding team who are OUT get revived.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tackle Point</h3>
    <p>When defenders prevent the raider from returning to the mid-line within 30 seconds of the raid, a tackle point is awarded to the defending team. The raider is forced out of play and a player from the defending team who is OUT gets revived.</p>
    <h3>All Out</h3>
    <p>When all players of a team are forced out of play, an All-Out is said to be inflicted upon them, with the opposition team being awarded two additional points. The play is started by reinstating all the seven players of the team back on court.</p>
    <h2>RAID CYCLE</h2>
    <h3>Raid Duration &amp Cant</h3>
    <p>A raid starts when a raider enters the opposition court. The maximum duration of each raid is 30 seconds and during the raid, the raider has to keep chanting the "Kabaddi Kabaddi" Cant.</p>
    <h3>Legitimate on Crossing Baulk Line</h3>
    <p>A raider first has to cross the baulk line to make the raid legitimate.</p>
    <h3>Bonus/Touch Point</h3>
    <p>Then, the raider can claim a bonus point by crossing the bonus line if there are six or more defenders on court. However, in this process, while one foot of the raider has to be between the bonus line and end line, his trailing foot has to be in the air.<br> OR <br>The raider can initiate a touch on any of the defenders. Once a touch has been initiated, the raider has to return to the mid-line without breaking the Cant within the 30 seconds of raid duration to make the raid successful.</p>
    <h2>SPECIAL EVENTS</h2>
    <h3>Empty Raids</h3>
    <p>If a raider returns back to the midline after crossing the baulk line without initiating a touch or claiming a bonus point, the raid is considered to be an empty raid with no points for either team.</p>
    <h3>Do-or-Die Raids</h3>
    <p>If a team has done two back to back empty raids, the third raid becomes a Do-or-Die raid for the team; meaning the third raid can’t be an empty raid with the raider necessarily having to score a point either by bonus or touch. In the event that the raider is unable to score a point in this raid, a point is awarded to the opposition team and the raider is deemed OUT.</p>
    <h3>Super Raid</h3>
    <p>A super raid is a raid in which a raider takes three or more points. Both bonus and touch points are considered in a super raid.</p>
    <h3>Super Tackle</h3>
    <p>When a defending team has three or lesser defenders on court and they successfully tackle an opposition raider, an additional point is awarded and the tackle is called a super tackle. However, this additional point doesn’t correspond to an additional player revival.</p>
    <h2>THE FIELD OF PLAY</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>COURT means the area on which Kabaddi matches shall be conducted measuring 13 meters x 10 meters.</li>
      <li>END LINE means the four boundary lines forming the court together. If any player (raider or defender) crosses this line during a raid, then that player will be removed from the field of play by the referee and sent to the bench. A point is awarded to the opposing team for each player removed from the court.</li>
      <li>LOBBY means the strips on both sides of the court. During a raid, if the raider or defender enters the lobby without any contact between the raider and the defenders, then those players will be removed from the field of play by the referee and sent to the bench. A point is awarded to the opposing team for each player removed from the court for entering the lobby illegally.</li>
      <li>MID LINE means the line that divides the court into two equal halves. It is the line a raider crosses to begin a raid by entering the opposing team’s half of the court. Within 30 seconds, the raider must come back and cross the mid line having either scored a point, or returning empty handed. If the raider doesn’t cross the mid line within 30 seconds, he is called ‘Out’ and is sent to the bench. A point is also awarded to opposing team.</li>
      <li>BAULK LINE means each of the lines in court parallel to the mid line. The distance of the baulk line from the mid line is 3.75 meters.
      This is an important line. When the raider begins a raid by crossing the mid line, he must first and foremost cross the baulk Line. The baulk Line legitimizes a raid and, hence if the raider fails to cross the baulk Line during a raid and crosses the mid line to return back into his team’s half, then the raider will be called ‘Out’. A point is awarded to the opposing team.
      </li>
      <li>BONUS LINE means the line between the baulk line and end line.
      The bonus line gives the raider an opportunity to score a point in his raid without the need to touch a defender through a Bonus point.
      </li>
      <li>The raider can claim a bonus point by crossing the bonus line if there are six or more defenders on court. However, in this process, while one foot of the raider has to be between the bonus line and end line, his trailing foot has to be in the air.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>TIME OUT</h2>
    <p>Each team is given an opportunity to have “one” time out during the entire match. During this time out, the clock is frozen and the team can consult their coach/manager. The time out is for “90” seconds only.</p>
    <h2>Coach Consultation:</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>THE FIELD OF PLAY</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The coach is allowed to give the instructions to the team only during the timeout or at the end of the half time. If the coach or the Manager tries to give the instructions to his/her team during the course of the match, the Referee may take action against such team and penalty of points may be awarded.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>TOURNAMENT POINTS SYSTEM</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In the group stages, the winning team will score 5 league points; and the losing team will score zero point, if the margin of victory is more than 7 points.</li>
      <li>In the group stages, the winning team will score 5 league points; and the losing team will score 1 point, if the margin of victory is 7 or less than 7 points.</li>
      <li>In case of a tie, both teams will score 3 league points each.</li>
      <li>In case of a tie, during the group stages, the team to qualify for the semi-final will be decided by the differential score calculated as the difference between total points won and total points conceded. The team with a higher differential score will qualify for the semi-final.</li>
      <li>In case of a tie even after differential score has been considered, only total points scored will be considered and the team that has scored more points will qualify for the semi-finals.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>EXTRA TIME (SEMI-FINALS &amp FINALS)</h2>
    <p>During the semi-finals and the finals, if at the end of 20 minutes the scores are tied, Extra Time is announced.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Extra Time of 5 minutes shall be awarded to decide the result of the match.</li>
      <li>Extra Time of 5 minutes will be divided in 2 halves of 2 minutes each with a break of 1 minute in between the two halves.</li>
      <li>The teams will have a fresh start with seven players of their choice (from out of the playing 12) on each side.</li>
      <li>Only one substitution will be allowed to each team during the extra time. Teams may substitute players during the break time of 1 minute which will not be counted as part of the 1 substitution permitted during game time of 4 minutes.</li>
      <li>If at the end of extra 5 minutes, the game is still tied, Golden Raid rule will apply as follows.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>GOLDEN RAID</h2>
    <p>In the event of a tie at end of Extra Time, the Golden Raid comes into play-<br>
    The referee will conduct a fresh toss. The team that wins the toss will have the chance to perform a GOLDEN RAID: A winner takes all raid, where the team that scores more points than the other, in that single raid, will be declared the winner.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Both the teams will field 7 Players in the Half.</li>
      <li>The baulk line shall be treated as Bonus Line and all the Bonus point rules shall be followed.</li>
      <li>If there is a tie after the first Golden Raid, then the opponent team will get a chance for the Golden Raid.</li>
      <li>If the game is still tied after both teams have been given a chance for Golden Raid, the winner will then be decided by a toss.</li>
      <li>The out or revival rule will not be applicable, only points scored will be counted.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All players playing shall ensure that they are not wearing any ornament or any item on their body which can lead to a potential injury to themselves or any of the opponents. This includes nails of which shall be closely clipped.</li>
      <li>Any unforeseen situation, dispute or any new situation not covered in the rules will be referred to the technical committee whose decision will be final and binding.</li>
