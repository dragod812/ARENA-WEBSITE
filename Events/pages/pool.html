    <h1>8-Ball Pool</h1>
    <p>Any of the following results in a game win:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A player legally pockets the 8 ball into a designated pocket, after all of that player's object balls have been pocketed.</li>
      <li>The opposing player illegally pockets the 8 ball (e.g. before clearing all of that player's object balls, does so on the same shot as the last such object ball, or the 8 falls into a pocket other than the one that was designated).</li>
      <li>The opposing player knocks the 8 ball off the table.</li>
      <li>The opposing player commits any foul, including scratching the cue ball into a pocket, or knocking it off the table, in the course of a shot that pockets the 8 ball.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Fouls:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The shooter fails to strike one of their own object balls (or the 8 ball, if all of said object balls are already pocketed) with the cue ball, before other balls (if any) are contacted by the cue ball. This excludes "<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#/split">split</a>" shots, where the cue ball strikes one of the shooter's and one of the opponent's object balls simultaneously.</li>
      <li>No ball comes into contact with a cushion or is pocketed, after legal cue ball contact with the (first) object ball (or 8 ball, if shooting for the 8).</li>
      <li>The shooter does not have at least one foot on the floor (this requirement may be waived if the shooter is <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Disability">disabled</a> in a relevant way, or the venue has not provided a <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#/mechanical_bridge">mechanical bridge</a>).</li>
      <li>The cue ball is shot before all balls have come to a complete stop from the previous shot.</li>
      <li>The cue ball is struck more than once during a shot.</li>
      <li>The cue ball is jumped entirely or partially over an obstructing ball with an illegal jump shot that scoops under the cue ball.</li>
      <li>The cue ball is clearly pushed (shoved slowly, rather than struck), with the cue tip remaining in contact with it more than momentarily.</li>
      <li>The shooter touches the cue ball with something other than the tip of the cue</li>
      <li>The shooter touches any ball (with body, clothing or equipment), other than as necessary to move the cue ball when the player has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#ball-in-hand">ball-in-hand</a>.</li>
      <li>The shooter knocks a ball off the table.</li>
      <li>The shooter has shot out-of-turn.</li>
      <li>On the break shot, no balls are pocketed and fewer than four balls reach the cushions (in which case the incoming player can demand a re-rack and take the break or force the original breaker to re-break, or may take ball-in-hand behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#head_string">head string</a> and shoot the balls as they lie)</li>
    </ul>
