    <h1>Snooker</h1>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker">Snooker</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_sport">cue sport</a> that is played on a baize-covered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baize">table</a> with pockets in each of the four corners and in the middle of each of the long side cushions. It is played using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_stick">cue</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker_ball">snooker balls</a>: one white <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#cue_ball">cue ball</a>, 15 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#red_ball">red balls</a> worth one point each (can also be played with fewer red balls, often 10), and six balls of different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#colour_ball"> colours</a>: yellow (2 points), green (3), brown (4), blue (5), pink (6), black (7).[1] A player (or team) wins a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#frame"> frame</a> (individual game) of snooker by scoring more points than the opponent(s), using the cue ball topot the red and coloured balls. A player (or team) wins a match when they have achieved the best-of score from a pre-determined number of frames. The number of frames is always odd so as to prevent a tie.</p>
    <h2>COMMON FOULS: </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Potting the white (in-off).</li>
      <li>Hitting a ball other than the white with the cue.</li>
      <li>Making a ball land off the table.</li>
      <li>Touching the cue ball with anything other than the tip of the cue (except while positioning the cue ball "in-hand"; while "in-hand" the cue ball may be touched by anythingexcept the tip of the cue).</li>
      <li>Playing a "jump shot" - a shot where the cue ball leaves the bed of the table and jumps over a ball before first hitting another ball.</li>
      <li>Playing a shot with both feet off the ground.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are three less common ways to end a frame:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A foul on the black, when the black is the only ball left. It is sometimes wrongly assumed that play continues after a foul on the black if there are fewer than seven points between the scores. This is not the case: the player who is in the lead following the assessment of a penalty after a foul when only the black remains is the winner.</li>
      <li>Failure to hit a ball "on" three times in a row, if the player has a clear sight of the ball. The referee will warn a player after a second such miss that a third miss will mean that the opponent will be awarded the frame. This rule does not apply if the player is snookered. As missing due to avoiding a direct shot on a ball is usually a tactical, rather than skill-related, outcome, this rule is rarely invoked, as a player will simply hit the ball directly on the third shot.</li>
      <li>If the score is tied after the final black is potted, the black is "respotted" and the cue ball put "in hand". The referee will then toss a coin, with the player winning the toss choosing who will take first strike at the black. Play then continues normally until the black is potted or another frame-ending situation occurs.</li>
    </ul>
